# Paoge Moua Portfolio

## Description
Greetings all newcomers,

My name is Paoge M., and welcome to my portfolio! Please feel free to browse through all of my public projects.

I'm a young professional with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and deep attachment to
community service and development. 

My affair with technology - from the past until now - all involve design and 
applications in every interest I pursue.  Now, into the future, I resolve to bring 
this affair into the light as my desire to mingle with the complexity of 
technological research, design and deployment. 

I have experience in web development technologies like JavaScript, Java, Python and
C-languages, as well as electronic hardware such as Apple products hardware.
